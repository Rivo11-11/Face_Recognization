# Face_Recognization
using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and a simple classifier to classify images (KNN). The dataset consists of 40 labels, representing 40 different classes, with each class containing 10 pictures. By implementing PCA, I aim to extract the most important features from the images, reducing their dimensionality while preserving the essential facial characteristics. The classifier then utilizes these reduced features to accurately identify and classify faces into their respective classes
